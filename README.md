# Graphing Application

## Overview

The Graphing Application is a React-based application that allows users to visualize data points on different types of graphs. Users can drag data points from a list and place them onto the graph canvas. The application supports line, scatter, and bar charts and includes functionality for editing and deleting data points.

## Features

- **Drag-and-Drop Data Points**: Easily drag data points from the list and drop them onto the graph canvas.
- **Graph Types**: Supports line, scatter, and bar charts.
- **Edit and Delete Data Points**: Edit or delete data points directly from the graph canvas.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Recharts**: Library for rendering charts.
- **React-Draggable**: For drag-and-drop functionality.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphing-application.git
   cd graphing-application
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action.

## Components

### `DataPointList.tsx`

- Displays a list of draggable data points.
- Handles the drag-and-drop functionality and notifies the parent component when a data point is dropped.

### `GraphCanvas.tsx`

- Renders the selected type of graph (line, scatter, bar) using Recharts.
- Displays data points on the graph.
- Provides edit and delete functionality for each data point.

### `App.tsx`

- Main component that integrates `DataPointList` and `GraphCanvas`.
- Manages the state of data points and graph type.
- Handles adding, editing, and deleting data points.

## Styling

- The application uses a dark theme with a primary accent color for the data points and controls.
- CSS styles are defined in `index.css` to ensure a modern and user-friendly interface.
- Includes responsive design considerations for better usability on different screen sizes.

## Future Enhancements

- **Additional Graph Types**: Support more graph types such as pie charts, area charts, etc.
- **Data Import/Export**: Allow users to import data from CSV files and export their data points.
- **Advanced Customization**: Enable users to customize the appearance and behavior of the graphs.
